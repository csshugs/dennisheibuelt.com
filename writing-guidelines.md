# Guidelines for writing good blog posts

## Find a good hook

A good hook can be the combination of a common problem you are going to provide a solution to with a funny or extraordinary anecdote. The goal is to draw the reader’s attention right from the beginning to minimize the risk of them loosing their interest in your content.

## Provide an informative intro

Incorporate your hook into an intro paragraph describing what the reader can expect from the article. As hooked as the reader should be, they still need to know why they are here to read your article. What are they about to learn from this and is this article the one they’ve actually searched for?

## Use graphics and other media

If a topic gets too complex, it might be a good idea to add a proper graphic helping to understand the matter at hand. Screenshots or little Screencasts/GIFs can also help visualizing a problem that would be difficult to explain by pure text.

## Conclude your post

Wrap up the post with a comprehensive conclusion of the most important points of the article’s content.
