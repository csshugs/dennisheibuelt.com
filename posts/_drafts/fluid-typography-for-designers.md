Fluid typography might be just another “trend” that puts you off just because of its buzzwordness. But if you ever implemented this technique fully in a project, you know how helpful it can be. What this approach requires though is grasping its technical functioning and the full commitment on `rem` units when it comes to font-sizes. This however can be daunting to project members as it is new/unfamiliar, especially to designers used to use only `px` values in their static and un-responsive design tools. But even frontend-savvy designers only have `px` units for fonts in Sketch. So how do we approach this technique when it comes to design tools?

## Why fluid typography?

- No more media-queries
- Ratio font-size to viewport always optimal (line length)

## How does it work?

- GIF (A GIF does say more than a thousand words)
- as the name suggests, the font size is not a fixed one, but fluid
- at least for a specific viewport range
- Define a min/max viewport, min/max font-size

| Thing         | Value         |
|:------------- |:------------- |
| min font-size | 16px          |
| max font-size | 22px          |
| min viewport  | 480px         |
| max viewport  | 1280px        |

- between that, fluid typography

## How to apply fluid typography in my design tool?

- **Decide** together in the Browser
- Export lists with fixed size for fixed viewport sizes.

## What font-size values do I use?

- Use lists

## Modular Scale

## What about spacings?

- Spacings in `rem` units, too
- Decide together
- Limit spacing variations

spacing and separation
spacing and distribution
spacing and rhythm
